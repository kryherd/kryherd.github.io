&lt;p&gt;I’ve completed four years. That’s &lt;strong&gt;crazy&lt;/strong&gt;! I thought I would take some time to reflect on and share gratitude for the things that keep me going and help me succeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-advisor&quot;&gt;My advisor&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every how-to guide on selecting a graduate program is going to say something about finding a good advisor – and they’re all right. To be honest, I did not follow these guides when I was applying to grad school. I found a list of potential PIs but I was too nervous to actually email most of them, and I definitely didn’t contact their grad students to learn more about lab culture. I was lucky that my advisor and I have similar enough working styles to promote harmony and efficiency in our work. She’s relatively hands-off (no micromanaging) but is very responsive to emails and other requests for feedback. My advisor is encouraging and open to many possibilities. When I told her I wanted to leave academia in favor of industry, she discussed my options with me rather than trying to convince me to stay on the tenure-track life plan. The key point here is that we are able to complement each other’s work. I’m grateful that I found a great match for an advisor, and I hope you do too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-support-system&quot;&gt;My support system&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grad school can be isolating. When I started, I was the only graduate student in a relatively new lab. I lived in an apartment with one other person who was rarely at home. I could go days without any significant in-person conversations. It was &lt;strong&gt;hard&lt;/strong&gt;. I was lucky, though, to have some new social connections at my advisor’s New Haven lab. I adopted a sweet cat. Over time, I strengthened these relationships and built new ones (I even met a great dude, and we moved in together!). I got a labmate! I am deeply grateful for the friendships I have been able to build during my time in Connecticut. I think that without them, my graduate experience would have been much, much harder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-work-life-balance&quot;&gt;My work-life balance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I keep a relatively strict work-life balance – I don’t work on weekends, and I usually don’t work late into the night. This is largely a result of the previous two points; I have an advisor who allows for flexibility and a great network of people to relax with during my downtime. I track all of the time I spend working or at the lab with an app called &lt;a href=&quot;https://toggl.com/&quot;&gt;Toggl&lt;/a&gt;, so I know how much time I actually spend working. It’s usually not more than 35 hours a week. I think that having this work-life balance has allowed me to stay mentally and physically healthy, and I am grateful for the chance to make it a priority.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>kryherd</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="reflection" /><summary type="html">So…</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/markdown.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Definition of Poor Comprehenders</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/UPCs/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Definition of Poor Comprehenders" /><published>2018-09-25T12:19:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-09-25T12:19:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/UPCs</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/UPCs/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;display:block;text-align:center&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/RegMethod.png&quot; alt=&quot;Profile Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this project, we investigated regression-based methods for classifying individuals with different reading profiles. We used these classifications to look at group differences in brain structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this project, I used R to run a variety of regression models, both to select the groups and later to test for group effects in brain structure. Because we tested many models and brain regions, I had to learn a lot more about for loops in R than I had known before.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>kryherd</name></author><category term="project" /><category term="data analysis" /><summary type="html"></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/RegMethod.png" /></entry><entry><title type="html">CARAT</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/CARAT/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="CARAT" /><published>2018-09-25T12:06:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-09-25T12:06:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/CARAT</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/CARAT/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;display:block;text-align:center&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/CARAT.png&quot; alt=&quot;Profile Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CARAT is a study looking at the neural bases of facial emotion perception, led by &lt;a href=&quot;https://comm.uconn.edu/faculty/buck/&quot;&gt;Ross Buck&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an IBRAIN fellow, I was the fMRI consultant for this project. I used Python and shell scripting to develop pipelines for optimization of the experimental design and preprocessing/analysis of the data. I helped coordinate the simultaneous eye-tracking and fMRI data.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>kryherd</name></author><category term="project" /><category term="ibrain" /><summary type="html"></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/CARAT.png" /></entry></feed>
