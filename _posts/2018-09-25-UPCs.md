**Time Period:** Spring 2016 - present

**Languages Used:** R

**Statistical Methods:** Linear regression, multiple imputation ([mice](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mice/index.html) and [missForest](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/missForest/versions/1.4) packages)

In this project, we investigated regression-based methods for classifying individuals with different reading profiles. We used these classifications to look at group differences in brain structure.

I used R to run a variety of regression models to select groups and test for group effects in brain structure. I learned how to efficiently run many models and create easily readable output.

All of the data and code for this project is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/kryherd/definitionofPCs).
