In this project, we investigated regression-based methods for classifying individuals with different reading profiles. We used these classifications to look at group differences in brain structure.

In this project, I used R to run a variety of regression models, both to select the groups and later to test for group effects in brain structure. Because we tested many models and brain regions, I had to learn a lot more about for loops in R than I had known before.
