## So...

I've completed four years. That's **crazy**! I thought I would take some time to reflect on and share gratitude for the things that keep me going and help me succeed.

### My advisor

Every how-to guide on selecting a graduate program is going to say something about finding a good advisor -- and they're all right. To be honest, I did not follow these guides when I was applying to grad school. I found a list of potential PIs but I was too nervous to actually email most of them, and I definitely didn't contact their grad students to learn more about lab culture. I was lucky that my advisor and I have similar enough working styles to promote harmony and efficiency in our work. She's relatively hands-off (no micromanaging) but is very responsive to emails and other requests for feedback. My advisor is encouraging and open to many possibilities. When I told her I wanted to leave academia in favor of industry, she discussed my options with me rather than trying to convince me to stay on the tenure-track life plan. The key point here is that we are able to complement each other's work. I'm grateful that I found a great match for an advisor, and I hope you do too!

### My support system

Grad school can be isolating. When I started, I was the only graduate student in a relatively new lab. I lived in an apartment with one other person who was rarely at home. I could go days without any significant in-person conversations. It was **hard**. I was lucky, though, to have some new social connections at my advisor's New Haven lab. I adopted a sweet cat. Over time, I strengthened these relationships and built new ones (I even met a great dude, and we moved in together!). I got a labmate! I am deeply grateful for the friendships I have been able to build during my time in Connecticut. I think that without them, my graduate experience would have been much, much harder.

### My work-life balance

I keep a relatively strict work-life balance -- I don't work on weekends, and I usually don't work late into the night. This is largely a result of the previous two points; I have an advisor who allows for flexibility and a great network of people to relax with during my downtime. I track all of the time I spend working or at the lab with an app called [Toggl](https://toggl.com/), so I know how much time I actually spend working. It's usually not more than 35 hours a week. I think that having this work-life balance has allowed me to stay mentally and physically healthy, and I am grateful for the chance to make it a priority.
