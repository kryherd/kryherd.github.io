Throughout my PhD, I've been involved in a bunch of projects. 

[CARAT](https://github.com/kryherd/CARAT){: style="text-align: center"}

![CARAT](/CARAT.png){: .image-carat} CARAT is a study looking at the neural bases of facial emotion perception, led by [Ross Buck](https://github.com/kryherd/CARAT).  

As an IBRAIN fellow, I was the fMRI consultant for this project. I used Python and shell scripting to develop pipelines for optimization of the experimental design and preprocessing/analysis of the data. I helped coordinate the simultaneous eye-tracking and fMRI data.
