Throughout my PhD, I've been involved in a bunch of projects.

![CARAT](/CARAT.png){: .image-carat} CARAT is a study looking at the neural bases of facial emotion perception, led by [Ross Buck](https://github.com/kryherd/CARAT).  

As an IBRAIN fellow, I was the fMRI consultant for this project. I used Python and shell scripting to develop pipelines for optimization of the experimental design and preprocessing/analysis of the data. I helped coordinate the simultaneous eye-tracking and fMRI data.

![CARAT](/RegMethod.png){: .image-UPC} In this project, we investigated regression-based methods for classifying individuals with different reading profiles. We used these classifications to look at group differences in brain structure.

In this project, I used R to run a variety of regression models, both to select the groups and later to test for group effects in brain structure. Because we tested many models and brain regions, I had to learn a lot more about for loops in R than I had known before.
