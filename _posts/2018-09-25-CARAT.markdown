CARAT is a study looking at the neural bases of facial emotion perception, led by [Ross Buck](https://comm.uconn.edu/faculty/buck/).  

As an IBRAIN fellow, I was the fMRI consultant for this project. I used Python and shell scripting to develop pipelines for optimization of the experimental design and preprocessing/analysis of the data. I helped coordinate the simultaneous eye-tracking and fMRI data.
