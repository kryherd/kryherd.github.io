**Time Period:** Fall 2017 - Spring 2018

**Languages Used:** Python, Shell

CARAT is a study looking at the neural bases of facial emotion perception, led by [Ross Buck](https://comm.uconn.edu/faculty/buck/).  

I created a processing pipeline for functional neuroimaging data, including image processing using [AFNI](https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/), data reshaping and cleaning in Python, and batch processing with shell scripting.

### Output

You can view code and extensive documentation for this project on [Github](https://github.com/kryherd/CARAT).
