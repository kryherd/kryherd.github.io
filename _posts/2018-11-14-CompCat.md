**Time Period:** Fall 2014 - Fall 2018

**Languages Used:** R

**Statistical Methods:** Linear mixed-effects modeling

This project investigated how adolescents with poor reading comprehension ability learn new categories. I designed the experiment and the data analysis. We found that poor comprehenders exhibit performance consistent with poor cognitive flexibility -- once they settle on a learning strategy, they tend to stick with that strategy even if it is suboptimal.

All of the data and code for this project is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/kryherd/CompCat). For a walkthrough of the analysis, see the [markdown](https://github.com/kryherd/CompCat/blob/master/DataCleaningandAnalysis.md) file.

### Output

**January, 2019:** A [publication](https://doi.org/10.1080/10888438.2019.1566908) detailing these results has been published in Scientific Studies of Reading.
