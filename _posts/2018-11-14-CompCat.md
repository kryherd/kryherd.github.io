**Time Period:** Fall 2014 - Fall 2018

**Languages Used:** R

**Statistical Methods:** Linear mixed-effects modeling

This project investigated how adolescents with poor reading comprehension ability learn new categories. I designed the experiment and the data analysis. We found that poor comprehenders exhibit performance consistent with poor cognitive flexibility -- once they settle on a learning strategy, they tend to stick with that strategy even if it is suboptimal.

All of the data and code for this project is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/kryherd/CompCat). For a walkthrough of the analysis, see the [markdown](https://github.com/kryherd/CompCat/blob/master/DataCleaningandAnalysis.md) file.
