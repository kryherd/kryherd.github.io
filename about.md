## Welcome!
	
My name is **Kayleigh Ryherd**. I'm currently a graduate student working with [Dr. Nicole Landi](https://psych.uconn.edu/faculty/nicole-landi/) in the [Developmental](https://devpsych.uconn.edu/) division of the [Department of Psychological Sciences](https://psych.uconn.edu/) at the [University of Connecticut](https://uconn.edu/).

Broadly, my research centers around how the brain understands language. My dissertation focuses on learning categories might be affected by our language ability. For a more in-depth look at my research background, check out my [CV](/CV/index.html).

I am an Associate of the [Neurobiology of Language](https://nbl.cogsci.uconn.edu/) program at UCONN. I also was a 2016 [CT Institute for the Brain and Cognitive Sciences (IBACS)](https://ibacs.uconn.edu/) [Summer Graduate Fellow](https://ibacs.uconn.edu/ibacs-summer-research-fellows) and a 2017-2018 IBACS [Research Assistant in Neuroimaging](https://birc.uconn.edu/ibrain-team/). 

I also enjoy playing with data. Check out the [Projects](/projects/index.html) page for some of the projects I've worked on.

In my spare time, I am passionate about cooking (especially [meal prep](https://mealprepchallenge.wordpress.com)), comedy, and my adorable cat.
