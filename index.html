<div id="home">
  <h2></i> Welcome.</h2>
	I'm currently a graduate student working with <a href="https://psych.uconn.edu/faculty/nicole-landi/">Dr. Nicole Landi</a> in the <a href="https://devpsych.uconn.edu/">Developmental</a> division of the <a href="https://psych.uconn.edu/">Department of Psychological Sciences</a> at the <a href="https://uconn.edu/">University of Connecticut</a>.
	<br><br>
	Broadly, my research centers around how the brain understands language. My dissertation focuses on language and category learning influence each other. 
	<br><br>
	I am an Associate of the <a href="https://nbl.cogsci.uconn.edu/">Neurobiology of Language</a> program at UCONN. I also was a 2016 <a href="https://ibacs.uconn.edu/">CT Institute for the Brain and Cognitive Sciences</a> (IBACS) <a href="https://ibacs.uconn.edu/ibacs-summer-research-fellows/">Summer Graduate Fellow</a> and a 2017-2018 IBACS <a href="https://birc.uconn.edu/ibrain-team/">Research Assistant in Neuroimaging</a>. 
	<br><br>
	I also enjoy playing with data. Check out some of the sidebar links for some of the projects I've worked on.
	<br><br>
	In my spare time, I am passionate about cooking (check out my <a href="https://mealprepchallenge.wordpress.com/">meal-prep challenges</a>), comedy, and my adorable cat.
